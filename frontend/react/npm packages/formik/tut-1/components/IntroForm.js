// Hey Prakhar, hope you had a great week start Mon today:smiley: 
// Can you please review my mini-project & give me feedback, will get clarity weather I'm writing react code properly.....

// Made a sample food-delivery-app, used useContext + useReducer hook to achieve the functionality.
// The combination is just awww....I mean how easy it becomes to manage state -> define initial state as an object, then reducer function we can include action type, multiple payloads, & dispatch it to consume for any component requirement. 
// I guess Redux will be more effective & fun, will be exploring soon....
